# blueshield-cli
An Azure Facade CLI project for Unknown_Company.

# Project Goals:

Our corporation want our Platform Engineers to build out a facade layer for our internal development teams so creating new Microsoft Azure components are done in a way that aligns with the business restrictions we have as a highly regulated insurance company.  
- There should be a script, (Python, C#, or Java), that is made available almost 1 to 1 with the top 10 components within Azure.
- There should be a way to do this using both a website and from the command line as well.
