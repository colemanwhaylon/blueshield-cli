# 1.1 Compliance Requirements Document

## Title: Azure Resource Creation Compliance Requirements

### Purpose:
To outline the compliance requirements and restrictions for creating Azure resources within the organization, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards and internal policies.

### Scope:
This document applies to all Azure resources created by internal development teams, including but not limited to Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, Kubernetes Clusters, and Databases.

### Compliance Requirements:

#### Data Residency:
- All data must reside in the East US 2 and Central US Azure regions to comply with local data sovereignty laws.
- No data or resources may be deployed in regions outside the approved list.

#### Resource Tagging:
- All Azure resources must include the following mandatory tags:
  - **Environment** (e.g., Production, Staging, Development)
  - **CostCenter** (e.g., Finance, HR, Engineering)
  - **Owner** (email of the resource owner)
- Tags must be applied at the time of resource creation and cannot be modified without approval.

#### Security and Access Controls:
- All resources must be created within a Virtual Network (VNet) with restricted access.
- Public IP addresses are prohibited unless explicitly approved by the Security Team.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be enforced, and only approved roles may be assigned.

#### Encryption:
- All storage accounts must use Azure-managed keys for encryption at rest.
- Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.

#### Auditing and Monitoring:
- Azure Monitor and Log Analytics must be enabled for all resources.
- All actions must be logged and retained for a minimum of 90 days for audit purposes.

#### Resource Naming Conventions:
- Resource names must follow the format:
  - `<ProjectName>-<Environment>-<ResourceType>-<Region>-<InstanceNumber>`
  - Example: ClaimsApp-Prod-VM-EastUS2-01

#### Approval Workflow:
- Any deviation from the above requirements must be approved by the Compliance Team via a formal request process.

#### Review and Updates:
- This document will be reviewed quarterly and updated as necessary to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or internal policies.

# 1.2 Business Requirements Document

## Title: Azure Resource Creation Business Requirements

### Purpose:
To define the business requirements for creating Azure resources, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and operational efficiency.

### Scope:
This document applies to all Azure resources created by internal development teams and outlines the business-driven constraints and best practices.

### Business Requirements:

#### Cost Management:
- All resources must be created with cost optimization in mind.
- Use Azure Reserved Instances for long-running workloads.
- Set budget alerts for all resource groups to prevent overspending.

#### High Availability and Disaster Recovery:
- Production workloads must be deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
- Backup and disaster recovery plans must be implemented for all critical resources.

#### Scalability:
- Resources must be designed to scale horizontally or vertically based on demand.
- Use Azure Auto-Scaling for applicable services (e.g., Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services).

#### Operational Efficiency:
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates (e.g., ARM, Terraform) for resource provisioning.
- Automate repetitive tasks using Azure Automation or Logic Apps.

#### Developer Productivity:
- Provide self-service capabilities for developers to create resources while enforcing compliance.
- Ensure the facade layer is intuitive and reduces the time required to provision resources.

#### Vendor Lock-In Mitigation:
- Where possible, use platform-agnostic solutions to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Document exit strategies for critical workloads.

#### Review and Updates:
- This document will be reviewed bi-annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in business priorities or operational strategies.

# 1.3 Risk Assessment Document

## Title: Azure Resource Creation Risk Assessment

### Purpose:
To identify and mitigate risks associated with the creation of Azure resources, ensuring compliance and operational stability.

### Scope:
This document applies to all Azure resources created by internal development teams and outlines potential risks and mitigation strategies.

### Risk Assessment:

#### Non-Compliance with Regulatory Standards:
- **Risk**: Fines, legal action, or reputational damage due to non-compliance.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce compliance requirements through the facade layer and conduct regular audits.

#### Unauthorized Access to Resources:
- **Risk**: Data breaches or misuse of resources due to improper access controls.
- **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC and enforce least-privilege access.

#### Cost Overruns:
- **Risk**: Unexpected costs due to unmonitored resource usage.
- **Mitigation**: Set budget alerts and use Azure Cost Management tools.

#### Resource Misconfiguration:
- **Risk**: Downtime or data loss due to improperly configured resources.
- **Mitigation**: Use pre-approved templates and scripts to ensure consistent configurations.

#### Vendor Lock-In:
- **Risk**: Difficulty migrating workloads to another cloud provider.
- **Mitigation**: Use platform-agnostic tools and document exit strategies.
