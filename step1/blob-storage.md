| **Business Requirement**                    | **Description**                                                                                         | **Compliance/Policy**                                                                                   | **Best Practice**                                                      | **Our Requirements** |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Data Retention Policy**                  | Define how long data should be retained in Blob Storage before being archived or deleted.               | Must comply with industry-specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or financial industry standards.    | Implement lifecycle management policies for data retention and deletion. |                                      |
| **Access Control**                          | Control who can access the Blob Storage and ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place.       | Must adhere to least-privilege access principle and role-based access control (RBAC).                  | Use Azure AD for authentication and Azure RBAC for authorization.      |                                      |
| **Encryption**                             | Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.                                                        | Must comply with encryption standards such as AES-256 for data at rest.                                 | Use Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) and HTTPS for data in transit.|                                      |
| **Data Classification**                    | Classify data stored in Blob Storage based on sensitivity levels.                                        | Follow data classification standards required by industry regulations (e.g., PII, PHI).               | Implement Azure Information Protection labels for data classification. |                                      |
| **Backup and Disaster Recovery**           | Implement backup strategies and disaster recovery plans to ensure data availability and business continuity. | Must align with business continuity plans and disaster recovery standards.                             | Use Azure Backup for automated backups and geo-redundant storage (GRS).|                                      |
| **Monitoring and Auditing**                 | Implement logging and monitoring to track access and usage of Blob Storage.                             | Must ensure audit logs are kept for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR audit trails).                    | Use Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to collect and analyze logs.|                                      |
| **Data Residency**                         | Define where the data is physically stored to comply with regional data residency laws.                 | Must comply with data residency laws, such as the EUâ€™s data residency requirements under GDPR.          | Store data in specific Azure regions (e.g., Europe, U.S.) based on requirements.|                                      |
| **Performance and Scalability**             | Ensure that Blob Storage can scale to meet business demands for large volumes of data.                   | Must meet performance benchmarks outlined in service level agreements (SLAs).                           | Use Azure Blob Storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) to optimize cost and performance.|                                      |
