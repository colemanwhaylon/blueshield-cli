# 1.2 Business Requirements Document

## Title: Azure Resource Creation Business Requirements

### Purpose:
To define the business requirements for creating Azure resources, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and operational efficiency.

### Scope:
This document applies to all Azure resources created by internal development teams and outlines the business-driven constraints and best practices.

### Business Requirements:

#### Cost Management:
- All resources must be created with cost optimization in mind.
- Use Azure Reserved Instances for long-running workloads.
- Set budget alerts for all resource groups to prevent overspending.

#### High Availability and Disaster Recovery:
- Production workloads must be deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
- Backup and disaster recovery plans must be implemented for all critical resources.

#### Scalability:
- Resources must be designed to scale horizontally or vertically based on demand.
- Use Azure Auto-Scaling for applicable services (e.g., Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services).

#### Operational Efficiency:
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates (e.g., ARM, Terraform) for resource provisioning.
- Automate repetitive tasks using Azure Automation or Logic Apps.

#### Developer Productivity:
- Provide self-service capabilities for developers to create resources while enforcing compliance.
- Ensure the facade layer is intuitive and reduces the time required to provision resources.

#### Vendor Lock-In Mitigation:
- Where possible, use platform-agnostic solutions to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Document exit strategies for critical workloads.

#### Review and Updates:
- This document will be reviewed bi-annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in business priorities or operational strategies.
