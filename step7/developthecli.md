# Wrapping Azure CLI Commands in a Custom CLI  

To wrap Azure CLI commands within your own command-line interface (CLI) while adding tracking, auditing, and control over available options, you can follow a structured approach. This involves creating a custom CLI tool that acts as a wrapper around the Azure CLI, intercepts commands, and enforces your desired functionality. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:  

## 1. Define Requirements  
- **Tracking**: Log who is using which commands and when.  
- **Auditing**: Store command execution details for later review.  
- **Control**: Restrict or modify certain Azure CLI commands and options.  
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on command usage.  

## 2. Choose a Programming Language  
Use a language that supports CLI development and has good Azure SDK support. Popular choices include:  

- **Python** (recommended for its simplicity and rich ecosystem)  
- **Node.js**  
- **Go**  
- **Bash** (for simpler use cases)  

For this example, we'll use **Python**.  

## 3. Create a Custom CLI Tool  
Use a Python library like [**click**](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) or **argparse** to build your CLI tool.  


## 4. Key Features of the Wrapper

- **Command Validation:**
  - Use the `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` dictionary to define which Azure CLI commands and options are allowed.
  - The `is_command_allowed` function checks if the command is valid.

- **Audit Logging:**
  - The `log_command` function logs the user, command, and timestamp to a file (`cli_audit.log`).

- **Command Execution:**
  - The `subprocess.run` function executes the Azure CLI command and captures the output.

- **User Identification:**
  - Replace `example_user` with a mechanism to identify the user (e.g., environment variables, login system).

## 5. Add Reporting

- To generate reports from the audit logs, you can create a script to parse the `cli_audit.log` file and summarize usage.

## 6. Deploy and Distribute

- **Package the Tool:**
  - Use `setuptools` to package your CLI tool for distribution.

## 7. Enhancements

- **User Authentication:**
  - Integrate with an identity provider (e.g., Azure AD) to authenticate users.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Restrict commands based on user roles.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  - Use a centralized logging system like Azure Monitor or ELK Stack for real-time monitoring.

- **Command Aliases:**
  - Create custom aliases for frequently used commands.
